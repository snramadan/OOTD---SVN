1. As a fashion-conscious adult, I want to have outfits recommended to me, so that I can try new clothing combinations.
2. As a student, I want to have pre-determined outfits ready to go, so that I can save time in the morning getting ready for class.
3. As a last minute planner, I want to know what clothes to wear in certain weather, so I donâ€™t wear the wrong articles of clothing.
